In this Python application, I developed a game of tic-tac-toe. When the program runs, a user
interface appears displaying an empty tic-tac-toe board. From there, the two players take 
turns until someone wins or the game results in a draw. In the menu, the user has the option
to restart the game or quit out of the game.
